symfony-boilerplate FrontendBundle
==================================

Use this bundle to organize all your frontend assets, like Javascripts and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) stylesheets, to be later handled, processed and compiled by [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/). The concepts of those bundle are mostly inspired by [Florian Eckerstorfer](https://twitter.com/Florian_)'s article, ["Building Symfony2 Applications with Gulp"](https://florian.ec/articles/buliding-symfony2-with-gulp/). Good job, man!
